# React Redux Template

This is a React Redux Template that quickly sets up the boiler plate for you!

> I have also setup a **Users** component for demo purpose because users entity is what you'll need in every applicaiton that you #build.

### Clone the Repo and just run the command

```
> npm install
> npm start
```
